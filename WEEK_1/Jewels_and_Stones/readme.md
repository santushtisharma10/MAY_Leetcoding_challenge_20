# Problem-Jewels and Stones
You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `a` is considered a different type of stone from `A`.

### Examples:
```
1. Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
   Output: 3

2. Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
   Output: 0
```
**NOTE:**

- `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.

- The characters in `J` are distinct.
