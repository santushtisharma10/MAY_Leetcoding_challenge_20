# Problem-Number Complement

Given a positive integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

### Example:
```
1. Input: num = 5
   Output: 2
   Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

2. Input: num = 1
   Output: 0
   Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

### Constraints:
- The given integer `num` is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
- `num >= 1`
- You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
