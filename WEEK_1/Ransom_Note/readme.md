# Problem - Ransom Note

Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

### Example:
```
1. Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
   Output: false

2. Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
   Output: false

3. Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
   Output: true
   
```
### Constraints:

- You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
